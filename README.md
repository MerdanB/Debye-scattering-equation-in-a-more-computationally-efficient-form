# Debye-scattering-equation-in-a-more-computationally-efficient-form

This r code applies DSE model in a computationally efficient form by using the equation given in **figure 1b** below. The error is negligible (if the bin size is small (0.001 in the R code)) by this approximation when compared with actual DSE equation in **figure 1a**. For more information, please read the below reference.
